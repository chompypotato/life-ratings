 <br>
  <h3>banana</h3>
 
 <br> <p1>here is a picture</p1>
 <br>   <img src="banana.jpg" alt="the picture i promised"> 
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
  <br>   <p1>now my website is amazing</p1>
  <br> <p1>ok now that the banana picture is out of the way let's rate the first thing</p1>
  <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
  <br> <h3>FOOD</h3>
  <br> <p1>this is a pretty vague thing to rate, but in general food is <b>3.5/5.0</b> for me </p1>
  <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
  <br> <h3>VIDEO GAMES</h3>
  <br> <p1>Video games are very fun and interactive even though they can make you rage sometimes, overall they are great <b>4.7/5.0</b></p1>
  <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
  <br> <h3>SHOES</h3>
  <br> <p1>Shoes are probably the most underrated thing ever. without them our feet would be torn up and infected probably.. even more but they are kidna epxensive, <b>4.6/5.0</b></p1>
  <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
  <br> <h3>CHEESE</h3>
  <br> <p1>Cheese tastes like heaven. do I need to say more. (unless you are lactose intolerant...) <b>4.7/5.0</b></p1>
  <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
  <br> <h3>STYLE SHEETS</h3>
  <br> <p1>i don't use one because I had no idea CSS existed until I made this and by then I was too lazy to add a style.css so I just added a style tag.<b>5.0/5.0</b></p1>
  <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
  <br> <h3>GEESE</h3>
  <br> <p1>Honestly geese are pretty cute and funny but when a Canadian goose is trying to rip you to shreds, it is not the best experience<b>3.5/5.0</b> </p1>
  <br> <img src="goose.gif" alt="MESS WITH THE HONK AND YOU GET THE BONK" style="width:128px;height:128px;"> 
  <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
  <br> <h3>FONTS</h3>
  <br> <p1>Most fonts are fine but my favorite is Courier New cause it is easy to read. The real reason why all of them are good is because times new roman sucks in my opinion <b>4.5/5.0</b></p1>
  <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
  <br> <h3>SCHOOL</h3>
  <br> <p1>School sucks but we need it to not be dumb. I think. It still sucks tho. <b>2.3/5.0</b></p1>
  <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
  <br> <h3>PIZZA</h3>
  <br> <p1>I know I already rated food but pizza is a special exception. Not only does it have cheese BUT it also has BREAD AND TOMATO SAUCE AND YOU CAN ADD MEAT<b>5.0/5.0</b></p1>
  <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
  <br> <h3>BRICKS</h3>
  <br> <p1>This is the rating result you get after 8 seconds. Anyways, bricks are very useful and I feel like we take them for granted becuase they support the shelter we live in. but they heavy and hurt kinda when you drop them on yo toes...<b>4.3/5.0</b> </p1>
  <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:black;background-color:black">
  <br> <h3>WEATHER</h3>
  <br> <p1> Now honestly this one depends because well obviously, weather is not one thing, and is not the same day to day but is pretty nice to have so it is a <b>4.3/5.0</b> </p1>
